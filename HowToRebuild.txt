Tried under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on i586 32 bit (must works under ARMs too)."

"Hi All,

Dr. Josef Templ, author of Ofront wrote me that OMinc has Ofront for CP
(not builded under BlackBox, but translating CP language to C).
Mr. Marc Frei has confirmed this information, and wrote me that this project
is not ready for publication, but OMinc agree to publish and will be work
at this line.

What is at nowadays? I'm not sure that the company is involved in this project
and want to publish something. I propose to further refine and improve Ofront
for translating Component Pascal language with help of community forces.
And maybe someone wants to invest this project?

To add interest I say that I have achieved success in trying to rebuild Ofront
from the sources.

Probably a good next step is porting Ofront for ARM architectures.
Is it simple? I don't know. Is it possible? Sure. Someone wants to help me?

I also have experience with the Ofront for BlackBox (I made some useful
modifications and improvements of it). And I see no problems to adapt Ofront
for translating CP language.

I want to remind you that now Ofront is available under BSD license."

"Hey, Oleg,
As you mentioned my blog post. it just works on 32 bit ARM GNU/Linux,
without any changes. Take the generated C files from any x86 GNU/Linux,
transfer them to arm and type make, basicly, that's all what you need
and you'll get native arm version.

If you don't succeed tell me I should have static version compiled on arm.
But it's too simple.

Besides I already (since early spring) have working version for 64bit
GNU/Linux on x86_64 because who ever uses 32 bit? Just never found time
to put it to my github, because I want to add some build system, which
will recognize module dependencies automatically, because we don't need
makefiles with Oberon, it has modules hierarchy."
